# Learning Objectives for Today's Class

- Explaining what is **version control** and why should you use it?  

- Understanding the **setup process for version control** using Git:    
  * Register for a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. 
  * Installing [Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) on your computer. 
  * Installing a Git Client

- Explaining what common **Git** commands mean.  

- Creating a **repo**, **tracking changes** and exploring a **file's history**.  

- Sharing information on the web (i.e., **remotes** -- we will use GitHub)

- **Collaborating** with other people.

- Connecting **RStudio to Git and GitHub**

- Running an example.

# Automated Version Control

---

```{r notFinal1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Source: www.phdcomics.com | title: 'notFinal.doc' | originally published: 10/12/2012", out.width = "40%", out.height = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/phd101212s.png")
```

**Note while this looks like a comic, many of the people in my generation did and experienced this.** `r emojifont::emoji(emojifont::search_emoji('frown'))[3]`

# Manual Version Control: A Personal Example

```{r notFinal2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Working on my first research grant. This is an example of both version control and commiting to a remote server.", out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/priorToGit.PNG")
```

**I am the first to admit that this was a RIDICULOUS system.**

---

# Embedded Version Control [1]

```{r embedded1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="A recent research project in Word.", out.width = "50%", out.height = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/embeddedVersionControl1.PNG")
```

**What are two limitations of track changes in a word document?**

---

# Embedded Version Control [2]

```{r embedded2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="A recent research project in Google Docs.", out.width = "90%", out.height = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/embeddedVersionControl2.PNG")
```

**A better approach for handling version control for word-processor type documents.**

# Version Control Systems

For flat (i.e., code, CSV, .txt) files, version control systems capture a **base version of the file** and record your progress as you progress. Unlike a Google Doc, the recording of progress/milestones have to be initiated by **YOU** through **commits**. 

**Some characteristics:**  

- You can think of the **track changes** as the process of recording different versions of our files.  

- You decide which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is called a **commit**), and keeps useful metadata about them.  

- In practice, a **commit** captures multiple files. It is the equivalent of versioning by adding your initials and/or date as seen in the PhD comic in Slide 4.  

- The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a **repository**.   

- Repositories facilitate collaboration among people working in different locations and time-zones.
